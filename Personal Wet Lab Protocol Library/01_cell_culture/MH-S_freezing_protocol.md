## 2. Prepare Complete Medium (with L-glutamine and 2-ME)

Example composition for **100 mL** complete medium:

- RPMI-1640 (no L-glutamine): 88 mL  
- FBS: 10 mL (10% v/v)  
- Pen/Strep (100×): 1 mL (1% v/v)  
- L-glutamine (200 mM stock): 1 mL → 2 mM final  
- 2-mercaptoethanol (2-ME, 50 mM stock): 100 µL → 0.05 mM final  

1. Warm RPMI, FBS, Pen/Strep, L-glutamine and 2-ME in a 37°C water bath for ~20 min.  
2. In a sterile bottle, add RPMI, then FBS, Pen/Strep, L-glutamine, and 2-ME.  
3. Gently invert to mix. Avoid vigorous shaking and bubbles.  
4. Label and store at 4°C. Warm to 37°C before use.

## 3. Harvest Cells After Routine Passage

> This protocol assumes that MH-S cells have just been passaged (e.g., split 1:4 or 1:6) using a scraper-based, non-enzymatic method, and you wish to freeze part of the remaining cell suspension.

1. After completing the routine passage and seeding new flasks for continued culture, keep the remaining cell suspension in a 15 or 50 mL conical tube.  
2. Gently mix the suspension to ensure cells are evenly distributed.  
3. If necessary, adjust the volume with complete medium to a convenient amount for counting (e.g. 5–10 mL).

---

## 4. Trypan Blue Dilution and Hemocytometer Loading

1. Gently resuspend the cell suspension.  
2. Take **20 µL** of the well-mixed cell suspension into a microtube.  
3. Add tryptan blue to achieve a **1:20 dilution** (e.g., 20 µL cells + 380 µL 0.4% trypan blue).  
4. Mix gently by pipetting up and down; avoid bubbles.  
5. Place a clean coverslip on the hemocytometer (Neubauer chamber).  
6. Load a small volume of the trypan blue–cell mixture into the chamber by capillary action.

> **Note:**  
> - Viable cells exclude trypan blue (unstained).  
> - Dead cells take up trypan blue and appear blue/blue-green.

---

## 5. Cell Counting with Hemocytometer

1. Under the microscope, focus on the four large corner squares (each containing a 4 × 4 grid of smaller squares).  
2. For each large square:
   - Count only **viable (unstained) cells** inside the square and on **two selected boundary lines** (e.g., top and left),  
   - Do **not** count cells on the opposite boundaries (to avoid double counting).  
3. Record the viable cell count for each of the four large squares.  
4. Calculate the average number of viable cells per large square:

   ```text
   Average count = (Q1 + Q2 + Q3 + Q4) / 4

5. Calculate the cell concentration (cells/mL) using:
    
    Cells/mL = Average count × Dilution factor × 10^4
    
    - Dilution factor here = 20 (for 1:20 with trypan blue).
        
    - 10⁴ is the volume conversion factor (each large square = 0.1 mm³ = 10⁻⁴ mL).
        
6. Calculate the total number of viable cells in the suspension:
    
    Total viable cells = Cells/mL × Suspension volume (mL)
    

---

## 6. Determine Freezing Plan (Cells per Vial and Number of Vials)

1. Decide the target number of cells per cryovial (typical range: **2–5 × 10⁶ cells/vial**, 1 mL total volume).
    
2. Compute the number of vials you can prepare:
    
    Number of vials = Total viable cells / Target cells per vial
    
3. Round down to an integer number of vials (to ensure each vial has at least the target number of cells).
    
4. Decide the final resuspension volume so that each vial will contain ~1.0 mL of freezing medium + cells.

## 7. Centrifugation and Preparation of Cell Pellet

1. Transfer the cell suspension to a suitable conical tube (if not already).
    
2. Centrifuge at **300–400 × g** (e.g., 1400 rpm) for **5 minutes** at room temperature.
    
3. Carefully aspirate and discard the supernatant using a vacuum aspirator, leaving the cell pellet intact.
    

---

## 8. Prepare Freezing Medium (90% FBS + 10% DMSO)

1. Prepare freezing medium fresh or from a pre-made aliquot:
    
    - 90% FBS
        
    - 10% DMSO
        
2. Mix gently and keep on ice or at 4°C during use.
    
3. **Recommended practice:**
    
    - Store bulk FBS and DMSO separately.
        
    - Prepare small aliquots of 90% FBS + 10% DMSO as needed and keep at −20°C.
        
    - Thaw an aliquot on ice just before use and avoid repeated freeze–thaw cycles.
        

---

## 9. Resuspend Cells in Freezing Medium

1. Estimate how much freezing medium is required:
    
    Required freezing volume (mL) = Number of vials × Final volume per vial (e.g. 1.0 mL)
    
2. Add an appropriate volume of cold freezing medium (FBS + 10% DMSO) to the cell pellet to achieve the desired cell concentration (e.g. 2–5 × 10⁶ cells/mL).
    
3. Gently resuspend the pellet by pipetting up and down with a serological pipette until the suspension is homogeneous.
    
4. Keep the tube on ice or at 4°C and work efficiently (DMSO is toxic to cells at room temperature over time).

## 10. Aliquot into Cryovials

1. Label each cryovial with at least:
    
    - Cell line (e.g. MH-S)
        
    - Passage (e.g. p13)
        
    - Cells per vial (e.g. 2.5 × 10⁶ cells/vial)
        
    - Freezing medium (90% FBS + 10% DMSO)
        
    - Date
        
    - Your initials
        
2. Gently mix the cell suspension and aliquot **1.0 mL** into each cryovial (or a defined volume you choose).
    
3. Ensure vials are tightly capped.

## 11. Freezing and Transfer to Liquid Nitrogen

1. Place the cryovials into a controlled-rate freezing container (e.g. Mr. Frosty or a foam box designed to achieve ~−1°C/min cooling).
    
2. Put the container into a **−80°C freezer** and leave it **overnight (12–24 hours)**.
    
3. On the next day, quickly transfer the cryovials from −80°C to the liquid nitrogen storage tank:
    
    - Preferably store in the vapor phase or as per institutional guidelines.
        

> **Important:** Do **not** place cell suspensions directly from room temperature/4°C into liquid nitrogen; uncontrolled rapid freezing will greatly reduce cell viability.

---

## 12. Cleanup and Waste Disposal

1. Flush the hemocytometer and coverslip thoroughly with water to remove trypan blue, then wipe with 70% ethanol and air-dry.
    
2. Dispose of all trypan blue–contaminated materials (tips, gloves, tissues) as **chemical/biohazard waste** according to local regulations.
    
3. Aspirate some disinfectant (e.g. Virkon solution) through the vacuum line and glass pipette to decontaminate the system.
    
4. Discard all tubes and pipettes that came into contact with cells as biohazard waste.
    
5. Wipe down the biosafety cabinet with 70% ethanol and, if desired, run UV sterilization for 15–20 minutes after work.

## 13. Documentation

Record the following information in your lab notebook or electronic log:

- Date of freezing
    
- Cell line and passage (e.g. MH-S, p13)
    
- Total number of vials and cells per vial
    
- Medium and freezing medium composition
    
- Counting details (average large-square count, dilution factor, calculated cells/mL)
    
- Any notable observations (cell morphology, viability, issues during freezing)
    

This protocol provides a standardized way to freeze MH-S cells back to stock, with explicit counting steps using trypan blue and a hemocytometer, and can be adapted to other adherent cell lines as needed.
