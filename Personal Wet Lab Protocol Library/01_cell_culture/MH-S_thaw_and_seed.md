# Standard Thawing and Seeding Protocol for MH-S Cells

**Cell line:** MH-S (murine alveolar macrophage cell line)  
**Culture vessel:** T75 flask (or equivalent)  
**Incubation conditions:** 37°C, 5% CO₂, humidified incubator  

---

## 1. Complete Medium (with L-glutamine and 2-mercaptoethanol)

**Base medium:** RPMI-1640  

**Final composition (example for 100 mL):**

- RPMI-1640 (without L-glutamine): 88 mL  
- FBS (heat-inactivated): 10 mL (10% v/v)  
- Penicillin–Streptomycin (100×): 1 mL (1% v/v)  
- L-glutamine (200 mM stock): 1 mL → 2 mM final  
- 2-mercaptoethanol (2-ME, 50 mM stock): 100 µL → 0.05 mM final  

> Adjust volumes accordingly if using different stock concentrations or if RPMI already contains L-glutamine. In that case, omit additional glutamine or modify volumes to maintain the desired final 2-ME concentration.

**Preparation:**

1. Thaw FBS, L-glutamine, and 2-ME stocks (if frozen) and equilibrate all components (RPMI, FBS, P/S, L-glutamine, 2-ME) in a 37°C water bath for ~20 minutes.
2. In a sterile bottle or 100 mL flask, combine:
   - RPMI-1640
   - FBS
   - Pen/Strep
   - L-glutamine
   - 2-mercaptoethanol
3. Gently invert several times to mix. Avoid vigorous shaking and foam formation.
4. Label with contents and preparation date.
5. Store at 4°C. Warm to 37°C before use.

## 2. Equipment and Biosafety Cabinet Preparation

1. Turn on the 37°C water bath and benchtop centrifuge.
2. Turn on the Class II biosafety cabinet (BSC):
   - Ensure the sash is at the recommended working height.
   - Turn on the fan (airflow) and light.
3. If UV disinfection is used:
   - With the sash fully closed and no one present, run the UV lamp for 15–20 minutes.
   - Switch off the UV lamp before starting work.
4. Spray the BSC work surface with 70% ethanol and wipe thoroughly.
5. Spray gloved hands with 70% ethanol before handling materials.

## 3. Retrieval of Frozen MH-S Cryovial from Liquid Nitrogen

1. Wear appropriate PPE for liquid nitrogen handling (cryo-gloves, lab coat, safety goggles).
2. Open the liquid nitrogen tank and locate the appropriate rack/box according to the cell storage map.
3. Identify the MH-S cryovial by label (cell line, passage, date).
4. Minimize exposure time to ambient temperature:
   - Transfer the cryovial quickly to a cryobox or directly to the cell culture room.
   - Proceed immediately to thawing.

---

## 4. Thawing the MH-S Cryovial

1. Pre-warm complete medium (with L-glutamine and 2-ME) in a 37°C water bath for ~20 minutes.
2. In the cell culture room, hold the MH-S cryovial in your hand and immerse only the lower part of the vial in the 37°C water bath.
   - Do **not** submerge the cap.
3. Gently swirl the vial in the water bath.
4. Thaw for ~30 seconds, until most of the ice is just melted and a small ice crystal may remain.
5. Remove the vial, spray the outside with 70% ethanol, wipe, and place it inside the BSC.

## 5. Gradual Dilution and Removal of DMSO

> Aim: dilute DMSO slowly to reduce osmotic shock, then remove it by centrifugation.

1. Inside the BSC, prepare a 1000 µL pipette with a sterile tip.
2. Gently open the cryovial.
3. Add ~1 mL of pre-warmed complete medium **slowly** to the cryovial while gently swirling or tapping.
   - Avoid vigorous mixing.
4. Gently pipette up and down a few times to mix, avoiding bubbles.
5. If any ice remains, allow it to melt completely at room temperature in the BSC for 1–2 minutes.
6. Transfer the entire cell suspension from the cryovial into a **15 mL conical tube**.
7. Add additional pre-warmed complete medium to the tube to reach a total volume of ~10–12 mL.
   - Gently invert or pipette to mix.

---

## 6. Centrifugation and Resuspension

1. Balance the 15 mL tube with a counterweight tube in the centrifuge.
2. Centrifuge at **~300–400 × g (e.g., 1400 rpm, depending on rotor)** for **5 minutes** at room temperature.
3. Carefully remove the tube and bring it back to the BSC.
4. Spray the outside of the tube with 70% ethanol before placing it inside the cabinet.
5. Using a vacuum aspirator with a sterile glass pipette, gently remove the supernatant without disturbing the cell pellet.
6. Add **~5 mL** pre-warmed complete medium (with L-glutamine and 2-ME) to the pellet.
7. Gently resuspend the pellet by pipetting up and down with a 5–10 mL serological pipette until the cell suspension is homogeneous.
   - Avoid vigorous pipetting and bubble formation.

---

## 7. Seeding into a T75 Flask

1. In a new T75 flask, pre-add **~15 mL** of pre-warmed complete medium.
2. Transfer the **~5 mL** resuspended MH-S cell suspension into the T75 flask, resulting in a final volume of ~20 mL.
3. Gently rock the flask in a cross pattern (front–back, left–right) to distribute cells evenly across the surface.
4. Label the flask clearly with:
   - Cell line: MH-S  
   - Passage (e.g., post-thaw passage 1)  
   - Date  
   - Medium composition (RPMI + 10% FBS + 1% P/S + 2 mM L-glutamine + 0.05 mM 2-ME)
5. Optionally, briefly check the seeded flask under an inverted microscope to document initial cell morphology and distribution.
6. Spray the outside of the flask with 70% ethanol and place it in the incubator at **37°C, 5% CO₂**.

## 8. Storage of Remaining Medium

1. Return any unused complete medium to the 4°C refrigerator.
2. Ensure the bottle is tightly closed and labeled with:
   - Medium composition  
   - Preparation date  
   - Expiry (according to lab policy)

---

## 9. Notes and Recommendations

- After thawing, allow MH-S to recover for at least 24 hours before changing medium, unless there is visible contamination or severe medium discoloration.
- Subsequent routine culture:
  - Change medium every 2–3 days, depending on cell density and medium color.
  - Passage cells at ~70–80% confluency using non-enzymatic methods or as per lab-specific subculturing SOP.
- Minimize freeze–thaw cycles of FBS, L-glutamine, and 2-ME stocks by aliquoting into small volumes.
- Always work under aseptic conditions and follow institutional biosafety guidelines.
