This document contains detailed laboratory protocols for the preparation of 0.5 M EDTA (pH 8.0) and 10× TBE buffer stock solutions, suitable for molecular biology applications such as gel electrophoresis.

## 📌 1. Preparation of 0.5 M EDTA (pH 8.0)

### Reagents

- Disodium EDTA dihydrate (Na₂EDTA·2H₂O), MW = 372.24 g/mol
- 1–2 M NaOH solution (for pH adjustment)
- Distilled or deionized water

### Final volume

- 500 mL

### Calculated amount

- 93.06 g Na₂EDTA·2H₂O

### Equipment

- Magnetic stirrer with heat
- pH meter or pH indicator strips
- Glass bottle or beaker
- Graduated cylinder
- Optional: NaOH pellets (if liquid NaOH not available)

### Protocol

1. Weigh **93.06 g** of Na₂EDTA·2H₂O directly into a glass bottle or beaker.
2. Add approximately **400 mL** of distilled water and a magnetic stir bar.
3. Begin stirring and gently heat the solution to **~60°C**.
4. Gradually add **1–2 M NaOH** dropwise while monitoring the pH.
5. EDTA will start dissolving as the pH increases; continue until the pH reaches **8.0–8.2** and the solution becomes clear.
6. Cool the solution to room temperature.
7. Adjust the final volume to **500 mL** with distilled water.
8. Label the bottle clearly with concentration, pH, date, and your name.
9. Store at **RT or 4°C**. Do **not autoclave**.

## 📌 2. Preparation of 10× TBE Buffer (Tris-Borate-EDTA)

### Reagents

- Tris base
- Boric acid (H₃BO₃)
- 0.5 M EDTA (pH 8.0) from previous protocol
- Distilled or deionized water

### Final volume

- 1 L (1000 mL)

### Composition

| Component     | Amount     |
|---------------|------------|
| Tris base     | 108.0 g    |
| Boric acid    | 55.0 g     |
| 0.5 M EDTA    | 40 mL      |
| Distilled water | Up to 1 L |

### Protocol

1. In a 1 L beaker or bottle, add **~500 mL** of distilled water and a magnetic stir bar.
2. Add **108.0 g Tris base** and **55.0 g boric acid**, stir until completely dissolved.
3. Add **40 mL of 0.5 M EDTA (pH 8.0)**.
4. Mix well and check the pH (typically around **8.3**); **no adjustment** is usually needed.
5. Bring the total volume to **1000 mL** with distilled water.
6. Mix thoroughly.
7. If long-term storage is required, autoclave the solution:
   - 121°C, 15–20 minutes, 15 psi
   - Loosen bottle caps before autoclaving
8. Label the stock:
10× TBE Buffer
Tris-Borate-EDTA | pH ~8.3
Volume: 1000 mL
Prepared by: Nora
Date: YYYY-MM-DD
Dilute 1:10 before use

9. Store at **room temperature** or **4°C**.

## 📎 Notes

- To prepare 1× TBE working solution, dilute the 10× stock:
- **1:10 ratio** (e.g., 100 mL 10× TBE + 900 mL water)
- EDTA solutions should never be autoclaved.
- Autoclaved TBE buffer is stable for several months at room temperature.
