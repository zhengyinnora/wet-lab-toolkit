## 🧊 Before You Start

- **Sample prep:** Keep paraffin sections at 60 °C for at least 1 h (or overnight).
- **All steps involving fluorescence should be performed protected from light.**
- **Use a humidified black incubation box during antibody incubation.**

## 🧪 Day 1 – Deparaffinization, Antigen Retrieval & Primary Antibody

### 1. Deparaffinization and Rehydration

| Reagent         | Time     |
|-----------------|----------|
| Xylol           | 5 min × 2 |
| EtOH 100%       | 1 min × 2 |
| EtOH 90%        | 1 min     |
| EtOH 80%        | 1 min     |
| EtOH 70%        | 1 min     |
| Aqua dest.      | 1 min     |

### 2. Heat-Induced Epitope Retrieval (HIER)

#### (1) Prepare Retrieval Buffer (per 100 ml)（For blue bracket (100 ml)）

- 10 ml HIER buffer:
  - **Option A:** Citrate Buffer HIER Citrate Buffer pH 6.0, 10X, REF ZUC028-500  
  - **Option B:** T-EDTA Buffer HIER T-EDTA Buffer pH 9.0, 10X, REF: ZUC029-500 
- 90 ml Aqua dest.

#### (2) Decloaking Chamber Program

1. Add 500 ml Aqua dest. to decloaking chamber (check cleanliness).
2. Place slides in retrieval buffer inside metal bracket, submerge completely.
3. Insert bracket (avoid bubble zones), close lid, power on, press `Start`.

**Program steps:**

| Step | Temperature | Time     | Notes                   |
|------|-------------|----------|--------------------------|
| Sp1  | 125 °C      | 30 sec   | Heating up takes ~30 min |
| Sp2  | 90 °C       | 10 sec   | Cooling down ~30 min     |

4. Press `Display Set` to monitor chamber temperature.
5. Once 125 °C is reached, Sp1 runs automatically. Then alarm rings.
6. Press `Start` again for Sp2 (cool down).
7. After alarm rings again, press `Stop`, open lid, remove bracket.
8. Cool slides for 10 min at RT.

#### (3) Gradual Cool Down

- Discard part of retrieval buffer, add 1X PBS, repeat 5–6 times to exchange solution gently.

### 3. Blocking

1. Rinse slides in 1X PBS, 2 times, 2 min each.
2. Prepare black box with moist paper and Aqua dest. to keep humidity.
3. Dry slide edges briefly, circle sample with histology pen.
4. Place slides in box, add **100 µl blocking buffer** per sample.
5. Incubate at room temperature (RT) for at least 1 h.

### 4. Primary Antibody Incubation

1. Wash slides with 1X PBS, 3 times, 2 min each.
2. Dilute primary antibody with Antibody Diluent (AD) (e.g., 1:50 to 1:500).
3. Add **100–150 µl** diluted antibody per sample.
4. Incubate at **4 °C overnight** in humidified dark box.

## 🌈 Day 2 – Secondary Antibody & DAPI + Mounting

### 1. Secondary Antibody & DAPI Incubation

1. Wash slides with **PBS-T (0.05% Tween20)**, 3 times, 2 min each.  
2. Dilute fluorescent secondary antibody 1:1000 with AD.  
   Add **100–150 µl** per sample, incubate **60 min at RT**.  
3. Wash with PBS-T, 3 times, 2 min each. Then wash once with 1X PBS (2 min).  
4. Dilute fluorescent DAPI **1:1000 with ddH₂O or PBS**, add 100–150 µl.  
   Incubate **15 min at RT**.  
   > *Alternatively, use ready-to-use DAPI (e.g., Abcam, Thermo) per instructions.*  
5. Wash with PBS or PBS-T, **3 times, 2 min**, then final wash with PBS once.

### 2. Mounting

1. Remove slides from PBS one by one (keep others in PBS).  
2. Dry excess liquid gently.  
3. Add 1–2 drops of **DAKO Mounting Medium** (per circle).  
4. Cover with proper-sized coverslip, remove air bubbles if needed.  
5. Let dry **≥1 h at RT, protected from light**.  
   > *If not imaging immediately, store slides at **4 °C in the dark**.*

## ✅ Notes & Tips

- Use appropriate fluorophore combinations to avoid channel overlap.  
- Always use clean forceps and avoid drying out tissues at any step.  
- Include negative controls (secondary only) for background check.  
- If autofluorescence is an issue, consider quenching (e.g., TrueBlack).
