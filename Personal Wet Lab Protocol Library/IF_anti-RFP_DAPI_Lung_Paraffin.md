Xylol 1	5 min
EtOH 100%	1 min
EtOH 100%	1 min
EtOH 90%	1 min
EtOH 80%	1 min

2. Epitope Retrieval
(1) Prepare Retrieval solution in bracket
For blue bracket (100 ml)		
Citrate buffer	10 ml	HIER Citrate Buffer pH 6.0, 10X, REF ZUC028-500
Or
HIER T-EDTA Buffer pH 9.0, 10X, REF: ZUC029-500
Auqa dest.	90 ml	

(2) Heat-Induced Epitope Retrieval (HIER)
1° Add 500 ml Aqua dest. Inside the decloaking chamber (check whether it is clean and dry before)
2° Place all the slides inside bracket with Retrieval solution. Place bracket into decloaking chamber (If only one bracket inside, put it away from the bubble area, 3 brackets or more are fine).
3° Close the lid properly. Switch on, press ‘start’ to start program
Program: Sp1   125 °C    30 s (heating time period: ca. 30 min)
                Sp2     90 °C     10 s (cooling down: ca. 30 min)
4° Press ’display set’ until ‘actual’ to show the actual temperature of the chamber (heating time period: ca. 30 min).
5 ° When the temperature reach 125 °C, sp1 starts automatically. After 30 s, sp1 finished and goes to sp2 and there is an alarm.
6 ° Press ‘Start’ to start sp2. It needs ca. 30 min to 90 °C.
7 ° After sp2 is finished, there is an alarm again. Press ‘Stop’ to end the program, open the lid and take bracket out to cool down for 10 min.
(3) Gradually cool down
After 10 min, discard some Retrieval solution, add some 1X PBS solution, discard some solution again. Repeat 5 to 6 times to make a gradual cool down of sides.
4. Blocking
(1) Move slides into 1X PBS solution in glassware, wash 2 time, 2 min/time.
(2) Prepare black incubation box, add some Aqua dest inside to keep a wet environment.
(3) Take some slides outside to dry a little bit, remove the solution on the back side as well as surrounding samples. Draw an intact circle with Histology pen. Place slides inside incubation box to keep the circle dry. Add some 1X PBS solution to avoid dry of the tissue.
(4) Put back all the slides inside1X PBS solution.
(5) Place all the slides inside the black incubation box, add 1-2 drop(100μL) of blocking solution, cover the box with the lid. Incubate for at least 1h at RT. (The incubation time can be prolonged)
5. Primary antibody incubation
(1) After 30 min, wash slides with 1X PBS solution for 2min 3times. Check integrate of circle.
(2) prepare the primary antibody：Dilute primary antibody with Antibody diluent (AD) solution，（1：50 or 1：500，according to the experiment）.
(3) Add 100-150 µl primary antibody onto each sample, incubate at 4 °C overnight.
Day 2
1. Secondary antibody & DAPI incubation
(1) Wash slides with PBS-T (Tween20 0.05%) solution, 3 times, 2 min/time.
(2) ) Dilute fluorescence secondary antibody 1:1000 with AD solution, add 100-150 µl, Incubate in RT for 60 min 
(3) Wash slides with PBS-T (Tween20 0.05%) solution, 3 times, 2 min/time, then wash with 1X PBS once (2 min) to remove residual Tween. 
(4) ) Dilute fluorescence DAPI 1:1000 with ddH2O or PBS, add 100-150 µl, Incubate in RT for 15 min. (Alternatively, use ready-to-use commercial DAPI (e.g., from Abcam or Thermo) according to the manufacturer’s instructions.)
(5) Wash slides with 1X PBS or PBS-T, 3 times, 2 min/time, then final wash with PBS once.

2. Mounting
(1) Take out slides from PBS solution(one by one, others stay in the PBS), dry slide a little bit, add drops of DAKO medium onside of samples(each ciecle), take proper size of cover side to on microscope slides. Remove bubbles if necessary. 
(2) Dry in the air at least 1 h at RT avoiding from light. PS: if don’t do microscope now, keep them in 4 degree.
