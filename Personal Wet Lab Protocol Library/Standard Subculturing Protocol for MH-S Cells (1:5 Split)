# Standard Subculturing Protocol for MH-S Cells (1:5 Split)

**Cell line:** MH-S (murine alveolar macrophage cell line)  
**Culture vessel:** T75 flask (or equivalent)  
**Medium:** Complete RPMI-1640 (RPMI-1640 + 10% FBS + 1% Pen/Strep ± L-glutamine ± 2-mercaptoethanol, according to lab standard)  
**Incubation conditions:** 37°C, 5% CO₂, humidified incubator

## 1. Pre-warm Medium and Prepare Biosafety Cabinet

1. Place complete culture medium in a 37°C water bath for approximately 20 minutes to pre-warm.
2. Prepare the Class II biosafety cabinet (BSC):
   - Ensure the sash is at the recommended working height.
   - Turn on the fan (airflow) and the light.
   - If UV disinfection is used, run the UV lamp only when the sash is closed and no one is present. Switch UV off before starting work.
3. Spray the BSC work surface with 70% ethanol and wipe thoroughly.  
4. Spray gloved hands with 70% ethanol before starting.

## 2. Assess Cell Confluency

1. Remove the MH-S culture flask from the incubator.
2. Spray the outside of the flask with 70% ethanol.
3. Examine the cells under an inverted microscope to assess density and morphology.
4. Proceed with passaging when confluency is approximately 70–80% and cells appear healthy.

## 3. Prepare Materials for Passaging

Prepare the following items and place them near the BSC:

- Current MH-S culture flask
- Two 50 mL conical tubes (Falcon tubes)
- Pre-warmed complete medium
- PBS without Ca²⁺/Mg²⁺ (if used)
- Cell scraper
- New T75 flask (pre-labeled with cell line, passage, split ratio, etc.)
- Serological pipettes (e.g., 5 mL / 10 mL)
- 1000 µL pipette and sterile tips
- Foot-operated vacuum aspirator with glass pipette (for waste aspiration)
- Biohazard waste container and disinfectant (e.g., Virkon or equivalent)

Inside the BSC:

1. Spray the outside of all bottles, tubes, and flasks with 70% ethanol.
2. Place them on the BSC work surface, keeping the central area free for handling and avoiding blockage of rear airflow.

## 4. Collect Cells and Centrifuge

> This protocol assumes MH-S are maintained as semi-adherent cells and uses a scraper-based, non-enzymatic harvest.

1. Gently swirl the culture flask to resuspend loosely attached and floating cells.
2. Using a serological pipette, transfer all culture medium (containing floating cells) into **50 mL Falcon tube 1**.
3. Gently place the flask flat in the BSC. Using a sterile cell scraper, carefully scrape the flask bottom to detach adherent MH-S cells.
4. Add approximately 20 mL of fresh, pre-warmed complete medium to the scraped flask.
5. Gently rinse the flask bottom and walls to resuspend all scraped cells.
6. Transfer this cell suspension into **50 mL Falcon tube 2**.
7. Balance the volumes in Tube 1 and Tube 2 (add medium if needed).
8. Centrifuge both tubes at **1400 rpm for 5 minutes** (or ~300–400 × g, depending on rotor radius).

## 5. Remove Supernatant and Resuspend Cells (1:5 Split)

1. After centrifugation, remove Tube 1 and Tube 2 from the centrifuge.
2. Spray the outside of both tubes with 70% ethanol and return them to the BSC.
3. Using the foot-operated glass aspirator, gently aspirate the supernatant from both tubes:
   - Begin by aspirating any surface bubbles.
   - Carefully approach the liquid surface to avoid disturbing the cell pellets.
4. Set the glass aspirator aside in a safe position.

5. Add approximately **5 mL of fresh, pre-warmed complete medium** to **Tube 1**.
6. Gently resuspend the pellet in Tube 1 using a serological pipette (avoid vigorous pipetting and bubble formation).
7. Transfer the entire resuspended cell suspension from Tube 1 into **Tube 2** (which also contains a pellet).
8. Gently resuspend the combined pellet in Tube 2 using a serological pipette until the suspension is homogeneous.
9. Switch to a 1000 µL pipette and gently pipette up and down to further homogenize the cell suspension, still avoiding bubbles.

10. For a **1:5 split**, aspirate **1 mL** of the well-mixed cell suspension and transfer it into a new, labeled T75 flask.
11. Add approximately **20 mL** of fresh, pre-warmed complete medium to the new flask.
12. Gently rock the flask in a cross pattern (front–back, left–right) to distribute cells evenly.

13. Optionally, briefly inspect the new flask under the microscope to verify cell distribution.
14. Spray the outside of the flask with 70% ethanol and return it to the incubator (37°C, 5% CO₂).

## 6. Clean-up and Waste Disposal

1. Use the vacuum aspirator to aspirate some disinfectant solution (e.g., Virkon or other approved disinfectant) through the glass pipette to rinse the inside of the waste line.
2. Place the glass pipette in its designated holder or cleaning area according to lab procedures.
3. Discard all tubes and flasks that have been in contact with cells into a lidded biohazard waste container.

4. For contaminated cultures or flasks:
   - Add an appropriate volume of disinfectant or 70% ethanol into the flask.
   - Gently mix to ensure contact with all residual fluid.
   - Tighten the cap and discard the flask into the lidded biohazard waste container.

5. Spray and wipe the BSC work surface with 70% ethanol.
6. Turn off the BSC light and fan when finished.  
   - If post-use UV disinfection is employed, close the sash and run the UV lamp for 15–20 minutes, then switch it off.

## Notes

- Passage frequency and split ratio may be adjusted based on MH-S growth rate, confluency, and experimental requirements.
- For functional assays (e.g., chemotaxis, receptor signaling), it is recommended to use cells that have not been recently exposed to proteolytic enzymes (e.g., trypsin) and have been passaged using non-enzymatic methods for several generations.
- Always follow local biosafety regulations and institutional guidelines for handling cell cultures and biohazardous waste.
