## 🧪 Day 1 — Lung Isolation

> (Standard dissection procedure not described here. Ensure tissue is clean and intact before dehydration.)

---

## 💧 Day 2 — Sucrose Dehydration (Cryoprotection)

### 1. Preparation of Sucrose Solutions

**15% Sucrose**  
- 6 g sucrose + 40 mL 1× PBS  
- Add sucrose first → add ~30 mL PBS → vortex → top up to 40 mL.

**30% Sucrose**  
- 12 g sucrose + 40 mL 1× PBS  
- Same method as above.

> ✅ Make sure sucrose is fully dissolved — undissolved crystals will alter the concentration and affect penetration efficiency.

---

### 2. Tissue Infiltration with Sucrose

- Add enough 15% sucrose to a Falcon tube (~10 mL), submerge lung tissue.
- Label tube with sample info (ID + date).
- Place on roller mixer for **≥24 h or until tissue sinks**.

Then:

- Replace 15% with 30% sucrose.
- Mix on roller for **≥48 h** (longer = better penetration).

> 🧠 Lung is soft and slow to sink — infiltration takes time. Sinking to the bottom indicates full saturation.

## 🧊 Day 3 — Embedding with OCT & Freezing

### 1. OCT Embedding

**About OCT**  
Optimal Cutting Temperature compound – contains PVA, PEG, and buffers. Solidifies on freezing to support soft tissues.

#### Steps:

**① Prepare Materials**
- Cryomold
- OCT at room temperature
- Forceps
- Tissue label

**② Positioning**
- Add a thin layer of OCT to bottom of cryomold.
- Place tissue **airway side up** on OCT.
- Gently adjust to lay flat, avoid curling or folding.

**③ Fill Mold**
- Slowly add OCT from the side to avoid bubbles.
- Fully submerge tissue.
- Ensure tissue sinks. If it floats, gently press with forceps until stable.

**④ Let Sit at RT for 1–2 h**
- Allows OCT to permeate tissue interior for better sectioning.

---

### 2. Freezing

**① Remove Bubbles**
- Push air bubbles to a corner, away from tissue, before freezing.

**② Freeze**
- Place mold directly on dry ice.
- Freeze completely (usually within a few minutes).

> 💡 Pro tip: For perfect freezing, use pre-chilled isopentane (–150 °C). But dry ice works fine for most purposes.

---

### 3. Storage

- Once fully frozen, store at **–80 °C**.
- Before cryosectioning, transfer to **–20 °C for 1–2 h** to soften block slightly and reduce cracking.

---

## 🪓 Day 4 — Cryostat Sectioning

### 1. Cryostat Setup

- Chamber temperature: **–20 °C**  
- Blade holder: **–18 to –22 °C**

> 💡 Lung sections crack if too cold, smear if too warm — –20 °C is ideal.

---

### 2. Block Equilibration

- Take block from –80 °C → equilibrate at –20 °C for 1–2 h.  
- Optionally pre-equilibrate in the cryostat chamber for a few minutes.

---

### 3. Mounting Block to Chuck

- Apply a dab of OCT on chuck.
- Press block onto it firmly, airway side facing up.
- Let it freeze and stabilize — this step determines section orientation.

---

### 4. Trimming

- Set thickness to ~30–50 µm.
- Trim away excess OCT until lung tissue surface is visible.
- Watch for white flaky ribbons — that’s the sign you're reaching tissue.

---

### 5. Sectioning

- Set section thickness: **5–10 µm** (8–10 µm is common for IF).
- Cut smoothly; section should curl into a ribbon.
- Use a small brush or tweezers + hand warmth to flatten ribbons.

---

### 6. Mounting Sections

- Use pre-cooled or room temp glass slide.
- Gently touch the section to the slide to transfer.
- A good mount = no bubbles, no tearing, clean pickup.

> 💡 Poor mounting causes section loss during IF washing steps.

---

### 7. Drying or Storage

- Options vary:
  - Air dry at room temperature.
  - Bake at 37 °C for 10 min.
  - Store immediately at –20 °C or –80 °C.
  - Proceed directly to IF staining.

---

## 📌 Notes

- Always label blocks and slides clearly.
- Record embedding date and lung orientation.
- Avoid embedding too many tissues in one mold — easier to control quality.
