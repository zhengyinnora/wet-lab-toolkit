## Day 1 — Mouse Lung Isolation & Perfusion Fixation Protocol

（小鼠肺取材 & 灌流固定）

### 1. Mouse Euthanasia

- Administer ketamine/xylazine mixture intraperitoneally at **50 µL / 10 g body weight**.  
    
- Confirm death before proceeding.
    

**Notes：**

- → 4°C
    
- ketamine **1 mL**
    
- xylazine **50 µL** → **1 mL**

### 2. Thoracic Cavity Exposure & Blood Drainage


- Open the abdominal skin and peritoneum.  
    
- Locate and cut the abdominal aorta to allow exsanguination.  
    
- Open the diaphragm and the rib cage to expose the lungs.  
    
- Carefully remove tissue around the trachea to free it.

### 3. Cardiac Perfusion

- Insert needle into the left ventricle; cut the right atrium for outflow(we dont do this).
    
- Slowly perfuse with ice-cold PBS until lungs appear blood-free.
    

---

### 4. Tracheal Intubation

- Insert a small catheter or blunt needle into the trachea.
    
- Fix the tube by tying suture around the trachea.

### 5. Lung Fixation via PFA Inflation

- Move mouse into chemical hood due to PFA use.（safety glasses）
    
- Connect the intubation tube to a pressure-controlled PFA delivery system.
    
- Slowly pump in **4% PFA (paraformaldehyde)** until the lungs are fully inflated.
    
- Wait a few minutes for fixation.
    
- Carefully remove lungs by dissecting from the trachea.
    
- Transfer lungs into **50 mL Falcon tube** filled with **4% PFA**.  
    
- Incubate overnight at **4°C**.

## Day 2. Dehydration

- Cut:
    
    - **left lung: the biggest lobe**
        
    - **right lung: the other lobes**
        
- **cassettes** (label with: mouse name/number/L or R)  
    
- **70% ethanol**
    
- **machine (Tissue Processor)** auto, **overnight**.

## Day 3. Embedding

_(To embed the dehydrated tissue in molten paraffin, allowing it to be cut into thin sections.)_  

1. Preheat the embedding station.
2. Prepare metal molds.
3. Add a small amount of paraffin.
4. Place the tissue in the mold .  
5. Fill the mold with paraffin.
6. Insert the label.
7. Cool the block (**15 min**).
8. Store at **4°C** and wait for sectioning.

## Day 4 — Sectioning (microtome)


**Temperatures：**

- microtome: **20°C**
    
- water bath temp for spreading sections: **40°C**
    
- slide drying plate temp: **40°C**
    

### (1) Preparation

- Embedding block securely embedded in paraffin and trimmed flat.  
    
- Ensure blade/knife is sharp and correctly positioned.
    
- Fix the paraffin block into the specimen holder.
    
- Set all the machines to the right temperature.
    
- Pre-warm the 40°C water bath. Prepare slides (**label all slides**).  
    

### (2) Trimming

- trim = **10**

## (b) Fein (Fine sectioning)

- → **3 µm**
    
- Rotate slowly and steadily for continuous unwrinkled sections.  
    
- Gently flatten curled ribbons using forceps if needed.  
    

## (c) Spreading & Collecting

- Float the ribbon on **40°C** water bath to allow tissue to flatten.
    
- Use a clean slide to pick up the tissue from the water surface **horizontally**.  
    
- Place the slide on the **40°C** heating plate for drying, **~30 min**.
