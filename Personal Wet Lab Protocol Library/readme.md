# readme.md


Welcome to my curated collection of wet lab protocols — a growing repository built from the ground up as part of my hands-on training in experimental biomedical research. This subfolder is part of the [`wet-lab-toolkit`](../) project.

These documents reflect my ongoing effort to document, understand, and refine each method I’ve learned — not just to reproduce experiments reliably, but to deepen my mechanistic understanding and ensure long-term reproducibility across studies.

This folder includes protocols I have:
- Learned and validated through hands-on experience  
- Modified or annotated based on lab-specific conditions  
- Structured for clarity and future reference


---

## Note for Future Readers

This folder intentionally retains the structure of a learning archive. It is not meant to demonstrate perfection — but to document a continuous learning process with emphasis on:
- Protocol reproducibility  
- Personal interpretation of steps  
- Adjustments based on reagent availability or tissue type  
- Honest notes on troubleshooting or deviations

If you're reviewing this repository in the context of future collaborations, I welcome feedback or discussion.
